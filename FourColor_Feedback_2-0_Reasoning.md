# Reasoning for Deduction Matrix – Feedback (2, 0)

**Guess:** (A, B, C, D)  
**Feedback:** 2 black, 0 white

---

## Interpretation of Feedback

- **2 black pegs**: Two guessed colors are in the secret code and in the correct positions.
- **0 white pegs**: No other guessed colors are in the secret code at all.
- So: two guessed colors are part of the secret (in correct position), and the other two are completely excluded.

## Deduction Principles Applied

1. **We Do Not Know Which Colors Are Which**:
   - We do not know which two of the four guessed colors are in the secret.
   - We do not know which two are completely excluded.

2. **Correct Positions Can't Be Confirmed Yet**:
   - We know the included colors must be in the correct position.
   - But since we don’t know which colors are included, we can’t confirm or eliminate any positions.

3. **Conservative Deduction**:
   - All four guessed colors are uncertain.
   - All positions are uncertain.
   - Therefore, everything is marked `?`.

## Final Deduction Matrix (2, 0)

| Color | In Code? | Pos 0 | Pos 1 | Pos 2 | Pos 3 |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| A     | ?        | ?      | ?      | ?      | ?      |
| B     | ?        | ?      | ?      | ?      | ?      |
| C     | ?        | ?      | ?      | ?      | ?      |
| D     | ?        | ?      | ?      | ?      | ?      |

This matrix reflects maximum uncertainty consistent with feedback (2 black, 0 white).
