# Scenario_03: Cross-Guess Deduction Using Greenwell Static Guesses

This scenario explores a new feedback path for the six fixed static guesses devised by Greenwell. As before, we assume a secret code composed of **4 distinct colors** from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and all deductions must follow the locked reasoning matrices and constraints from previous deduction files.

## ðŸ“‹ Scenario Overview: Guesses and Feedback

| Guess # | Guess         | Feedback            |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| G1      | (0, 1, 1, 0)  | TBD                 |
| G2      | (1, 2, 4, 3)  | TBD                 |
| G3      | (2, 2, 0, 0)  | TBD                 |
| G4      | (3, 4, 1, 3)  | TBD                 |
| G5      | (4, 5, 4, 5)  | TBD                 |
| G6      | (5, 5, 3, 2)  | TBD                 |

## ðŸ”’ Project Rules (Summary)

- Secret uses **4 distinct** colors from 0â€“5
- Feedback pegs:
  - **Black** = correct color in correct position
  - **White** = correct color in wrong position
- Feedback constrained by guess type:
  - 2-color guesses: max of 2 pegs
  - 3-color guesses: max of 3 pegs
  - 4-color guesses: only 11 feedback types valid (see `guidelines.md`)
- All deduction must conform to locked logic and matrices

## âœ… Deduction Section (To Be Completed Incrementally)

Each guess and its feedback will be analyzed in turn. Once feedback is assigned to G1, analysis begins and proceeds step-by-step, leveraging previous conclusions and matrices.

Once the final secret code is logically forced from available feedback, a deduction matrix will be finalized as in Scenario_01 and Scenario_02.
