# Scenario\_03: Cross-Guess Deduction Using Greenwell Static Guesses

This scenario explores a new feedback path for the six fixed static guesses devised by Greenwell. As before, we assume a secret code composed of **4 distinct colors** from the set {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and all deductions must follow the locked reasoning matrices and constraints from previous deduction files.

## üìã Scenario Overview: Guesses and Feedback

| Guess # | Guess        | Feedback           |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| G1      | (0, 1, 1, 0) | (0 black, 2 white) |
| G2      | (1, 2, 4, 3) | (1 black, 2 white) |
| G3      | (2, 2, 0, 0) | (1 black, 1 white) |
| G4      | (3, 4, 1, 3) | (0 black, 2 white) |
| G5      | (4, 5, 4, 5) | (1 black, 0 white) |
| G6      | (5, 5, 3, 2) | (0 black, 1 white) |

## üîí Project Rules (Summary)

* Secret uses **4 distinct** colors from 0‚Äì5
* Feedback pegs:

  * **Black** = correct color in correct position
  * **White** = correct color in wrong position
* Feedback constrained by guess type:

  * 2-color guesses: max of 2 pegs
  * 3-color guesses: max of 3 pegs
  * 4-color guesses: only 11 feedback types valid (see `guidelines.md`)
* All deduction must conform to locked logic and matrices

## üß† Final Deduction Summary

### ‚úÖ Final Code: (2, 0, 4, 1)

Using the constraints in the final deduction matrix:

* Color 1 is locked at position 3
* Color 0 is only allowed at position 1
* Color 2 can be at position 0
* Color 4 can be at position 2

This gives the code: **2, 0, 4, 1**

### üîç Feedback Verification:

**G1 = (0, 1, 1, 0)** ‚Üí (0 black, 2 white)

* 0 guessed at 0 & 3 ‚Üí secret has 0 at pos 1 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ
* 1 guessed at 1 & 2 ‚Üí secret has 1 at pos 3 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ

**G2 = (1, 2, 4, 3)** ‚Üí (1 black, 2 white)

* 1 at pos 0 ‚Üí secret has 1 at pos 3 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ
* 2 at pos 1 ‚Üí secret has 2 at pos 0 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ
* 4 at pos 2 ‚Üí secret has 4 at pos 2 ‚Üí black ‚úÖ

**G3 = (2, 2, 0, 0)** ‚Üí (1 black, 1 white)

* 2 at pos 0 ‚Üí secret has 2 at pos 0 ‚Üí black ‚úÖ
* 0 at pos 2 ‚Üí secret has 0 at pos 1 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ

**G4 = (3, 4, 1, 3)** ‚Üí (0 black, 2 white)

* 4 at pos 1 ‚Üí secret has 4 at pos 2 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ
* 1 at pos 2 ‚Üí secret has 1 at pos 3 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ

**G5 = (4, 5, 4, 5)** ‚Üí (1 black, 0 white)

* 4 at pos 2 ‚Üí secret has 4 at pos 2 ‚Üí black ‚úÖ

**G6 = (5, 5, 3, 2)** ‚Üí (0 black, 1 white)

* 2 at pos 3 ‚Üí secret has 2 at pos 0 ‚Üí white ‚úÖ

All feedbacks match the code (2, 0, 4, 1).

‚úÖ **This is the only configuration consistent with all constraints and feedback.**

## üîÅ Cross-Guess Logic Highlights

### ‚ùå Why Color 0 Cannot Be in Position 2

Let‚Äôs examine what happens if we try placing color 0 in position 2.

From G3 = (2, 2, 0, 0) with feedback (1 black, 1 white):

* Color 0 was guessed at positions 2 and 3
* Color 2 was guessed at positions 0 and 1

Now assume:

* Color 0 is actually in position 2 (matching its guess position in G3)
  ‚Üí This would be the **black peg**

That leaves the **white peg** to come from color 2

* But color 2 was guessed in positions 0 and 1
* If color 2 were actually at position 0 or 1, it would have been a **black** peg, not white

So we‚Äôd get **2 black pegs**, contradicting the (1 black, 1 white) feedback

‚úÖ Therefore, this assignment leads to a contradiction

**Conclusion:** Color 0 **cannot** be in position 2

### ‚úÖ Deductions from G1 = (0, 1, 1, 0) ‚Üí (0 black, 2 white)

* Guess includes only two colors: 0 and 1
* Color 0 appears at positions 0 and 3
* Color 1 appears at positions 1 and 2
* Feedback (0, 2) means:

  * Exactly one instance of 0 and one instance of 1 are in the secret, but in the wrong positions
  * The other instances of 0 and 1 are not contributing pegs

#### Deduction Matrix Update

## üéØ Final Deduction Matrix

The following matrix reflects the final state of all color-position constraints after complete deduction. It summarizes which colors are in the secret code and where they can or cannot appear.
‚ùå        | X      | X      | X      | X      |

### ‚úÖ Deductions from G3 = (2, 2, 0, 0) ‚Üí (1 black, 1 white)

* Guess includes only colors 2 and 0
* Feedback: 1 black, 1 white

Implications:

* Exactly one of the four pegs is correct in color and position
* One other peg is correct in color but at the wrong position
* The remaining two pegs are not in the secret

From G1, we already know:

* Color 0 is in the secret
* Positions 0 and 3 are excluded for color 0

Now:

* Feedback confirms color 0 contributes either the black or white peg
* The other peg must come from color 2

Suppose color 0 is placed at **position 2**. Then it would match its guess position in G3, meaning it contributes the black peg. That would require the white peg to come from color 2.

However, in G3, color 2 appears at positions 0 and 1. If color 2 were in either of those positions in the actual code, it would also have contributed a **black** peg. That would mean G3 results in **2 black**, not (1 black, 1 white), which contradicts the feedback.

‚û°Ô∏è Therefore, color 2 cannot have been the white peg unless it appears in a different position in the code ‚Äî but only positions 0 and 1 were guessed.

‚ùå Contradiction.

‚úÖ So color 0 **cannot** be in position 2 ‚Äî otherwise G3 would produce incorrect feedback.

We must eliminate position 2 for color 0.

| Color | In Code? | Pos 0 | Pos 1 | Pos 2 | Pos 3 |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2     | ‚úì        | ?     | ?     | ?     | X     |

### ‚úÖ Deductions from G5 = (4, 5, 4, 5) ‚Üí (1 black, 0 white)

* Colors guessed: 4 and 5 (each appears twice)
* Feedback: 1 black, 0 white

Implications:

* Exactly one of these colors is in the secret code and is in the correct position
* The other color is not in the secret at all

We do not yet know which color is excluded and which is included

At this point, we know:

* Colors 0, 1, and 2 are in the code
* G5 tells us that exactly one of 4 or 5 is in the code
* That accounts for all 4 secret colors

‚û°Ô∏è Therefore, **color 3 is not in the secret** ‚Äî it is excluded

### ‚úÖ Deductions from G2 = (1, 2, 4, 3) ‚Üí (1 black, 2 white)

* All four guessed colors are already determined:

  * 1: in the code
  * 2: in the code
  * 4: in the code
  * 3: **not in the code** (already excluded)

Feedback: (1 black, 2 white) means:

* Three of the guessed colors are in the secret
* One is not ‚Äî that is color 3

So:

* Colors 1, 2, and 4 contribute the pegs (1 black, 2 white)
* One of them is in the correct position
* Two are correct colors in wrong positions

We cannot yet determine which color is which peg, but this cross-confirms that:

* 4 is the color included from {4, 5}
* 5 is not in the code

#### Matrix Update

| Color | In Code? | Pos 0 | Pos 1 | Pos 2 | Pos 3 |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 4     | ‚úì        | ?     | X     | ?     | X     |
| 5     | ‚ùå        | X     | X     | X     | X     |

### ‚úÖ Deductions from G4 = (3, 4, 1, 3) ‚Üí (0 black, 2 white)

* Guessed colors: 3, 4, 1, 3
* Feedback: (0 black, 2 white)

Analysis:

* Color 3 is **not in the code** (already excluded), so cannot contribute
* Colors 4 and 1 are in the code and must contribute the 2 white pegs
* That means:

  * Color 4 is not in position 1 (its guess location)
  * Color 1 is not in position 2 (its guess location)

This provides new positional exclusions.

#### Matrix Update

| Color | In Code? | Pos 0 | Pos 1 | Pos 2 | Pos 3 |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 4     | ‚úì        | ?     | X     | ?     | X     |
| 1     | ‚úì        | X     | X     | X     | ‚úì     |

### ‚úÖ Deductions from G6 = (5, 5, 3, 2) ‚Üí (0 black, 1 white)

* Guessed colors: 5, 3, 2
* From earlier analysis:

  * Color 5 is not in the secret (‚ùå)
  * Color 3 is not in the secret (‚ùå)
  * Color 2 **is** in the secret (‚úì)

Feedback: (0 black, 1 white)

* Therefore, the one white peg must come from color 2, and it is in the wrong position
* In G6, color 2 is in position 3 ‚Üí position 3 is **not** correct for color 2

#### Matrix Update

| Color | In Code? | Pos 0 | Pos 1 | Pos 2 | Pos 3 |
| ----- | -------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2     | ‚úì        | ?     | ?     | ?     | X     |
