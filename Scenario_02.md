# Scenario_02: Alternate Feedback Path for Static Guesses

This scenario analyzes a different set of feedback responses for the standard six fixed static guesses in Mastermind, based on Greenwellâ€™s sequence. The goal is to apply the locked deduction rules to determine the secret code using only logical inference.

## ðŸ“‹ Scenario Overview: Guesses and Feedback

| Guess # | Guess         | Feedback  |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| G1      | (0, 1, 1, 0)  | (0 black, 2 white) |
| G2      | TBD           | TBD       |
| G3      | TBD           | TBD       |
| G4      | TBD           | TBD       |
| G5      | TBD           | TBD       |
| G6      | TBD           | TBD       |

We will proceed through the feedbacks one at a time, adding analysis and deductions for each.

## âœ… Deductions from G1 = (0, 1, 1, 0) â†’ (0, 2)

### Feedback Interpretation
- **0 black**: None of the guessed colors are in the correct position.
- **2 white**: Two of the guessed colors are in the secret code, but in wrong positions.

### Guess Details
- Colors guessed: 0 and 1
- Distribution: Color 0 at pos 0 and 3; Color 1 at pos 1 and 2

### Deduction Logic
- Only **two pegs match**, and all are white.
- Therefore, one instance of **color 0** and one instance of **color 1** are in the secret.
- These correct instances are **not** at the guessed positions.

### Deduction Matrix
| Color | In Code? | Pos 0 | Pos 1 | Pos 2 | Pos 3 |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | âœ“        | X      | ?      | ?      | X      |
| 1     | âœ“        | ?      | X      | X      | ?      |

This deduction aligns with the locked matrix for a 2-color guess with (0,2) feedback.
