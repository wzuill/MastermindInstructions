# Guidelines for ChatGPT

These are the reasoning and coding guidelines for building a static Mastermind solver based on Greenwell‚Äôs fixed guesses. These instructions are to be followed by ChatGPT when constructing code, tests, and deduction logic for this problem.

## General Principles
- Write code in small, verifiable steps, confirming correctness through focused microtests.
- Make no assumptions about feedback behavior ‚Äî all reasoning must be explicitly justified.
- The secret code is always a 4-color code drawn from 6 available colors, with **no repeated colors**.
- Guesses may include repeated colors, but final deduction logic must respect the uniqueness constraint of the secret.

## Code Structure
- Separate logic into clear responsibilities: feedback analysis, constraint tracking, and deduction propagation.
- Use descriptive and precise class and method names.
- Keep each class focused on a single responsibility.
- Where possible, treat sets of possible values as immutable to avoid side-effects.

## Testing (Microtests)
- Each method should be verified by its own test case.
- Avoid combining multiple logical behaviors in one test.
- Assert constraint refinements explicitly (e.g., exclusion of a color from a position).
- Include tests for both presence and absence of specific deductions.

## Deduction Logic
- Compare feedback results across multiple guesses to rule out or confirm options.
- Apply each feedback rule and propagate consequences through all known constraints.
- Once a position is resolved to a single color, treat it as known and use it to further reduce other positions.
- Never hard-code solution outcomes; all solutions must emerge through reproducible deduction.

### üîÑ Guess Order vs. Analysis Order
In the static version of Mastermind using Greenwell‚Äôs six fixed guesses, **all guesses are made before any feedback is analyzed**. The **order in which the guesses are made does not matter** to the correctness of the final solution.

However, the **order in which feedback is analyzed** can influence the **clarity, speed, and simplicity** of deduction.

- Some feedback results (e.g., `(0, 0)` or `(2, 0)`) may yield strong immediate constraints and are often easiest to analyze first.
- Deductions may be more effective when **processed in an order that eliminates ambiguity early** or isolates specific colors or positions.
- This mirrors how a human might work: mentally prioritizing the most definitive clues, even though all guesses are already fixed.

> Therefore, while the **guess set is fixed and unordered**, the **analysis order is strategic** and may be chosen dynamically based on the feedbacks received.

## üî¢ Valid Feedback by Guess Type

### One Distinct Color (e.g. `(0, 0, 0, 0)`)
Possible feedback outcomes:
- `(1, 0)`
- `(0, 0)`

### Two Distinct Colors (e.g. `(0, 1, 1, 0)` or `(2, 3, 3, 2)`)
Possible feedback outcomes:
- `(2, 0)`
- `(1, 1)`
- `(1, 0)`
- `(0, 2)`
- `(0, 1)`
- `(0, 0)`

### Three Distinct Colors (e.g. `(0, 1, 2, 1)` or `(2, 3, 4, 2)`)
Possible feedback outcomes:
- `(3, 0)`
- `(2, 1)`
- `(2, 0)`
- `(1, 2)`
- `(1, 1)`
- `(1, 0)`
- `(0, 2)`
- `(0, 1)`
- `(0, 0)` ‚ùå Invalid (cannot occur with 3 distinct colors and no duplicates)

### Four Distinct Colors (e.g. `(0, 1, 2, 3)` or `(3, 4, 5, 0)`)

Only the following 11 feedback results are possible and should be supported for deduction logic:

(4,0) ‚Äî All four colors correct and in correct positions  
(3,0) ‚Äî Three correct in position, one color not in secret  
(2,2) ‚Äî Two correct in position, two correct in wrong position  
(2,1) ‚Äî Two correct in position, one correct in wrong position  
(2,0) ‚Äî Two correct in position, two not in secret  
(1,3) ‚Äî One correct in position, three correct in wrong positions  
(1,2) ‚Äî One correct in position, two correct in wrong positions  
(1,1) ‚Äî One correct in position, one correct in wrong position  
(0,4) ‚Äî All four guessed colors are correct but in wrong positions  
(0,3) ‚Äî Three guessed colors are correct but in wrong positions  
(0,2) ‚Äî Two guessed colors are correct but in wrong positions

The following feedbacks **cannot** occur under the 4-distinct-color constraint and must be treated as invalid:

(3,1) ‚Äî Impossible due to color reuse conflict (would require 5 distinct colors in secret)  
(1,0) ‚Äî Requires 3 secret colors not in guess (not enough available colors)  
(0,1) ‚Äî Requires 3 secret colors not in guess (not enough available colors)  
(0,0) ‚Äî Requires 4 secret colors not in guess (impossible with only 6 total colors)

Any feedback outside the valid set above should be treated as logically inconsistent under the no-duplicates rule and must not be allowed during deduction processing.

## ‚ùó Constraint: Feedback Limitations for 2-Color Guesses

When a guess contains only **two distinct colors**, and the secret code contains **no duplicate colors**, then the **maximum number of total pegs (black + white)** in feedback is **2**.

Therefore, the only valid feedback combinations for 2-color guesses are:
- `(0, 0)`
- `(0, 1)`
- `(0, 2)`
- `(1, 0)`
- `(1, 1)`
- `(2, 0)`

All other feedback values ‚Äî such as `(1, 2)`, `(2, 1)`, or `(2, 2)` ‚Äî are **impossible** under this constraint and should be treated as invalid.

This rule helps detect feedback errors and reduces the deduction search space.
